  <h2>About me:</h2>
    <p>I am a curious individual who loves solving problems and trying new things. Often in life, this comes with a fear of "diving in". When I was just a toddler, my parents and I were standing on the dock of the family lake cabin when an idea popped into my head. <em>"I think I'm gonna do something,"</em>my mom heard me say as I leaped into the late-April water. It was a shock to the system, but I learned a lesson that has stuck with me all my life: the best way to learn something new is to <strong>dive in!</strong></p>
