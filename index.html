    <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>I am a curious individual who loves solving problems and trying new things. Often in life, this comes with a fear of "diving in". When I was just a toddler, my parents and I were standing on the dock of the family lake cabin when an idea popped into my head. <em>"I think I'm gonna do something," </em>my mom heard me say as I leaped into the late-April water. It was a shock to the system, but I learned a lesson that has stuck with me all my life: the best way to learn something new is to <strong>dive in!</strong></p>
    <h2>Background:</h2>
      <p>I am originally from good ol' Spokane, Washington and moved to Portland about 5 years ago. Soon after moving to Portland, I joined my friend's band, which led to joining a few more until I was immersed in the music scene. From then on writng and playing music was my main pastime, while I worked full-time as a care provider for adults with special needs.<br><br> With COVID-19 throwing everyone for a loop in 2020, I began thinking more and more about my future and how I needed to make a drastic change in my career path. A few friends of mine had completed the full-time course at Epicodus and are now working happily in tech. With their advice and encouragement I decided to go all in and sign up for the program with no prior coding experience. I am beyond excited and hopeful to see where my future in coding will lead me!</p>
